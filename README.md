### 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are some projects I’m excited about:

#### 🎥 YouTube_Control_Using_Hand_Gestures
Control YouTube playback with a wave of your hand! This project uses **computer vision** to detect hand gestures and translate them into actions like play, pause, or volume control.  
- **Why It’s Cool**: Makes video navigation touch-free and fun!  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe  
- **Try It**: Check out the [repository](https://github.com/rahul5r/YouTube_Control_Using_Hand_Gestures) for setup instructions and gesture mappings.  

#### 👁️ Eye_Tracking_Cursor_Control_System
Navigate your screen using just your eyes! This system tracks eye movements to move the cursor, offering an innovative way to interact with your computer.  
- **Why It’s Cool**: Ideal for accessibility or hands-free computing.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, OpenCV, Dlib  
- **Get Started**: Visit the [repository](https://github.com/rahul5r/Eye_Tracking_Cursor_Control_System) to set it up and explore the code.  

#### ✅ To-Do List App
Stay organized with this sleek and simple **To-Do List App**. Add, edit, and check off tasks with ease to keep your day on track.  
- **Why It’s Cool**: Minimal design, maximum productivity.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Tkinter (or specify your framework if different)  
- **Check It Out**: Head to the [repository](https://github.com/rahul5r/To-Do-List-App) to run it locally or suggest new features.  

#### 🤖 ML-Models
A collection of **machine learning models** tackling diverse problems, from classification to regression and beyond. This repo showcases my experiments with real-world datasets and algorithms.  
- **Highlights**: Includes models like decision trees, neural networks, and more, applied to practical use cases.  
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (adjust based on your tools), Pandas  
- **Dive In**: Explore the [ML-Models repository](https://github.com/rahul5r/ML-Models) to see my work and try the notebooks yourself.
